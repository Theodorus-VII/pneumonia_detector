            This AI-Powered Pneumonia Diagnosis tool is a web-based application
            that uses artificial intelligence to assist in the diagnosis of
            pneumonia from chest radiography (X-rays). Pneumonia is a serious lung
            infection that can affect anyone, especially children, elderly, and
            people with weak immune systems. It can cause fever, cough, difficulty
            breathing, and even death. According to the World Health Organization,
            pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five
            years old, killing more than 800,000 children

              >every year</a
            >. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial for
            effective treatment and prevention.

            We are three students who created this project as part of a University
            Project. We wanted to learn more about machine learning and deep
            learning, and apply them to a real-world problem.

            We used Python and TensorFlow to train our model on an

            >
            of 5863 chest X-ray images, labeled into two categories: pneumonia and
            normal. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to
            build our pneumonia detection system. As part of the integration into
            a web-app, we also used TensorFlow.js to run our model in the browser,
            ensuring privacy and accessibility for our users. No data is sent to a
            server, and the model and prediction are run locally directly in the
            browser. The code for our project is also open source and is available
            on

              Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious lung infection that can
              affect people of all ages. It is usually diagnosed by a doctor based
              on the patient's symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and
              chest X-ray. However,
              <em>diagnosing pneumonia can be challenging</em>, especially in
              low-resource settings where access to medical facilities and equipment
              is limited. Moreover, chest X-ray images can be difficult to
              interpret, and different radiologists may sometimes have different
              opinions on the final diagnosis.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-black bg-gradient rounded w-100 w3-center text-light p-5 mx-2">
              That is why we think that an AI system can be a useful tool for
              assisting doctors in diagnosing pneumonia. Our system can analyze
              chest X-ray images and give a probability score for pneumonia. This
              can help doctors add another layer of security to their diagnosis, and
              avoid false negatives.

              However, our system is not a replacement for normal medical
              diagnosis, and it should not be used as the sole basis for any
              health decisions. We always recommend that users consult a doctor
              for professional advice and treatment.

            We hope that our project can help people who are at risk of pneumonia,
            especially in developing countries where access to medical facilities
            and resources is limited. We also hope that our project can inspire
            other students and developers to use AI for social good.
